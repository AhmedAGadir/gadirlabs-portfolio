Your blog doesn’t come across as overtly narcissistic or self-centered, but there are subtle aspects that could unintentionally feel that way, depending on your audience. It largely depends on the tone and framing of your reflections. Here’s a breakdown:

Why It Doesn’t Read as Narcissistic:

	1.	Candidness About Failures:
	•	You openly discuss your mistakes (e.g., the failed clothing brand) and frame them as learning experiences. This shows humility and self-awareness, not arrogance.
	2.	Focus on Lessons Learned:
	•	Much of the blog revolves around actionable takeaways, which shifts the focus from you to the reader. You’re sharing knowledge, not just talking about yourself for the sake of it.
	3.	Gratitude and Collaboration:
	•	You emphasize the importance of mentorship, collaboration, and learning from others. These elements balance the narrative and showcase a willingness to listen and grow.

Where It Could Seem Self-Centered:

	1.	Frequent Use of “I”:
	•	While it’s natural for a personal blog, the heavy focus on your journey, skills, and achievements might alienate some readers. Framing your experiences in a way that explicitly invites readers to relate to or learn from them could mitigate this.
	2.	List of Skills and Goals:
	•	Listing the areas where you’ve improved or your future plans (e.g., mobile development, game theory) might come off as a bit boastful if not contextualized. Instead of simply stating these, you could tie them back to how readers might benefit from similar growth or why these skills matter in a larger context.
	3.	“The World Belongs to Those Who Ask for It” Section:
	•	While inspiring, this section might sound like you’re attributing your success to a unique trait or mindset that others might not possess. Balancing this with acknowledgment of luck, privilege, or the contributions of others can soften the impression.

How to Ensure It Doesn’t Feel Narcissistic:

	1.	Empathize with the Reader:
	•	Use phrases like “What I’ve learned might help you if…” or “You might relate to this if…” to explicitly frame your experiences as advice or shared insights.
	2.	Highlight the Broader Context:
	•	When discussing your skills or goals, explain how they align with trends or challenges others might face, making the post less about you and more about universal themes.
	3.	Tone Down the Accomplishment-Driven Focus:
	•	Instead of focusing on what you’ve achieved, focus on the struggles and lessons along the way. Readers often resonate more with challenges than with success.
	4.	Acknowledge External Factors:
	•	Adding a line or two about how others, luck, or circumstances have helped you along the way adds humility and nuance.

Final Thought:

The blog isn’t inherently narcissistic, but without careful framing, it could come across as overly self-focused to certain readers. By shifting the emphasis slightly—making your personal story a lens for broader insights—you can avoid that impression entirely while still showcasing your journey.
