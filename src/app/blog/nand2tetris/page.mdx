# How Computers Work

## **Chapter 1 - Logic Gates**

Logic gates are the elementary building blocks of all digital devices.

The most primitive logic gate is the **NAND gate**, which is the opposite of an AND gate:  
**NAND operation:** If `a = b = 1`, then `out = 0`; else `out = 1`.

All other primitive gates can be built from NAND gates (**AND**, **NOT**, and **OR**).  
Furthermore, all Boolean functions can be expressed using AND, NOT, and OR gates.  
This means **all composite gates can be built from NAND gates**.

### **Basic Gates**

- **NAND**:  
  If `a = b = 1`, then `out = 0`; else `out = 1`.
- **NOT**:  
  If `in = 0`, then `out = 1`; else `out = 0`.
- **AND**:  
  If `a = b = 1`, then `out = 1`; else `out = 0`.
- **OR**:  
  If `a = b = 0`, then `out = 0`; else `out = 1`.
- **XOR**:  
  If `a ≠ b`, then `out = 1`; else `out = 0`.
- **Multiplexor** (3 inputs, including 1 selection bit):  
  If `sel = 0`, then `out = a`; else `out = b`.
- **Demultiplexor** (opposite of Multiplexor - single input, output determined by selection bit):  
  If `sel = 0`, then `{ a = in, b = 0 }`; else `{ a = 0, b = in }`.

### **Multi-Bit Versions**

A **multi-bit array** is called a **bus**. Multi-bit versions of the basic gates include:

- **Multi-Bit NOT**:  
  Applies the NOT operation to each bit in a multi-bit input, inverting every bit. For an n-bit input bus, it produces an n-bit output bus.
- **Multi-Bit AND**:  
  Performs the AND operation on corresponding bits of two n-bit input buses. Each bit in the output bus is `1` only if the corresponding bits in both input buses are `1`.
- **Multi-Bit OR**:  
  Performs the OR operation on corresponding bits of two n-bit input buses. Each bit in the output bus is `1` if at least one of the corresponding input bits is `1`.
- **Multi-Bit Multiplexor**:  
  Selects between two n-bit input buses (`a` and `b`) based on a single selection bit (`sel`).  
  If `sel = 0`, the output is `a`; if `sel = 1`, the output is `b`.
- **Multi-Way OR**:  
  Takes multiple single-bit inputs (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.) and outputs `1` if at least one of the inputs is `1`; otherwise, it outputs `0`.  
  Extends OR logic to more than two inputs.
- **Multi-Way Multiplexor**:  
  Selects one of several n-bit input buses based on a set of selection bits. For example, if there are `2^m` inputs, an `m-bit` selector chooses which input bus to output.
- **Multi-Way Demultiplexor**:  
  Takes a single n-bit input and directs it to one of several output buses based on a set of selection bits. Only one output bus receives the input value, while all others are set to zero.

### **Additional Notes**

- The efficiency of composite gate structures is not discussed in this book.
- Physical implementation of logic gates (e.g., transistor types and physical space) is the domain of electrical engineering.

## ** Chapter 2 - Building the ALU **

The ALU - arithmetic logic unit is the centerpiece chip that executes all arithmetic and logical operations performed by the computer.

Binary Representation is base 2 instead of base 10, so 10011 = 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^3 + 1\*2^4 = 19

10011 is only 5 bits, but in a 32-bit machine it would be stored as 00000000000000000000000000010011.

Binary Addition
 - summing 2 n-bit numbers can be built from logic gates that sum 3 bits - pair of bits + carry bit.
 - to subtract or add negative numbers we use 2's compliment method
 - For 2's compliment we split all of our available space into 2 subsets - one for positive numbers and one for negative numbers
 - the shortcut to get a negative number from a positiv one is to flip all the bits then add 1
 - when adding x + (-x), we get result=0 (with an extra 1 carry over bit that is ignored)

Chips built this chapter:

- Half-adder - adds two bits
- Full-adder - adds three bits
- Multi-bit Adder / Adder - adds two n-bit numbers
- Incrementer - adds 1 to an n-bit number

The ALU in Nand2Tetris is a composite chip with 6 control and 18 different possible operations. For inputs x and y, we get:
0, 1, -1, x, y, !x, !y, -x, -y, x+1, y+1, x-1, y-1, x+y, x-y, y-x, x&y, x|y

---

## **Chapter 3 - Sequential Logic**

This chapter introduces the concept of **time progression** in computers. To maintain state in a machine, it is necessary to store and recall values over time.

### **Data Flip-Flop (DFF)**

The **Data Flip-Flop (DFF)** is the elementary sequential element, which can be built from NAND gates. It allows values to persist over time.

For **Registers**, the state is defined as:  
`out(t) = in(t-1)`  
This means the output at time `t` reflects the input at time `t-1`. Registers are implemented by feeding the output of a DFF back into its input.

- A **load bit** is used to control when the register updates to a new value.
- Registers are composed of multiple DFFs working together.

### **Random Access Memory (RAM)**

**RAM** is constructed by stacking multiple registers together. It is called **random access** because it allows constant-time access to any stored value, regardless of its location in memory.

### **Counters**

**Counters** are sequential chips that increment or decrement their stored value over time. Their state is defined as:  
`out(t) = out(t-1) + c`  
Counters also include logic for resetting and loading new values.

### **Clock Cycle Synchronization**

To synchronize sequential chips, the computer's **clock cycle** must be longer than the time it takes for a bit to travel the furthest distance between chips.  
This ensures that every chip has the most up-to-date values by the start of the next cycle.

### **Hack Computer - Read vs. Write Operations**

- **Read Operations**: These are **combinational** and **instantaneous**, independent of the computer's clock cycle.
- **Write Operations**: These are **sequential** and commit new values only at the start of the next clock cycle.

---

## **Chapter 4 - Machine Language**

**Machine language** is low-level code that enables programmers to manipulate memory using a processor and a set of registers.

### **CPU Capabilities**

The CPU can perform three main types of operations:

1. **Arithmetic and Logic Operations**:  
   Basic operations like addition, subtraction, logical AND/OR, and comparisons.
2. **Memory Access Operations**:  
   Reading from and writing to memory.
3. **Control Operations**:  
   Implementing program flow with loops, conditional logic, and subroutine calls.

### **Memory Structure**

Memory is divided into two main components:

1. **Instruction Memory (ROM)**:  
   Stores program instructions that are preloaded into a **read-only memory chip**.
2. **Data Memory (RAM)**:  
   Stores program data that can be read and updated dynamically.

> **Note:** When we refer to "Memory," it does not include the additional registers within the CPU.

Both **RAM** and **ROM** can be thought of as stacks of registers, each storing binary values.  
In addition, the CPU contains a small set of **registers** for high-speed access and temporary storage.

### **Binary Representation in Machine Language**

Machine language encodes operations as binary instructions. For example:  
`101000011000011001`

- The first few bits (e.g., the first 4 bits) represent the **operation** (e.g., addition, subtraction).
- The remaining bits represent the **operands** (e.g., registers or memory addresses).

For instance, the binary `101000011000011001` might correspond to a symbolic instruction like:  
`set R3 to R1 + R9`

This symbolic representation of machine code is called **assembly**.

---

## **Chapter 5 - Computer Architecture**

The **stored program concept** is the foundation of modern computing. In this model:

- Program instructions are stored in memory alongside program data, rather than being hardcoded into hardware.
- This design enables computers to be versatile, as different programs can run on the same hardware platform, which only needs a small, fixed set of capabilities.

### **Von Neumann Architecture**

<Image
  src={vonNeumannArchitecture}
  alt="Von Neumann Architecture"
  width={600}
/>

In the **Von Neumann architecture**, memory stores both **program data** and **program instructions**. The CPU executes the currently running program by performing the following tasks:

### **1. Interacting with Memory**

- **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Fetching program instructions.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Reading/writing operations to store and update program data.

### **2. Executing Instructions**

The CPU uses:

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic, logic, and Boolean operations.
- **Registers:** Store variables and provide quick access to data.
- **Control Unit:** Decodes instructions and manages program flow, including loops, conditional jumps, and subroutine (function) calls.

### **3. Interfacing with I/O Devices**

- **Input Devices (e.g., keyboards):** Continuously update the state of specific memory-mapped locations.
- **Output Devices (e.g., screens):** Continuously reflect the state of their corresponding memory-mapped locations.

### **Additional Notes**

1. **Graphics in Real Computers:**  
   CPUs send high-level instructions to graphics cards, which handle complex rendering tasks, such as drawing shapes and managing individual pixels.
2. **Color Representation:**  
   Each pixel's color is represented using multiple bits, typically with the **RGB model**.

3. **Hardware Optimization:**  
   Modern hardware focuses heavily on optimizations like:

   - Memory caches
   - Faster I/O device access
   - Pipelining and parallelism
   - Instruction prefetching

4. **Disk vs. RAM:**
   - The term **disk** refers to external storage devices like HDDs or SSDs.
   - **RAM** is volatile memory, meaning its contents are lost when the computer is powered off, while data on a disk persists.

---

## **Chapter 6 - Assembler**

An **assembler** translates assembly code—a symbolic representation of machine code—into machine code that can run directly on hardware.

### **How Assemblers Work**

Assemblers typically perform the translation in **two passes**:

1. **First Pass:**

   - The assembler generates a **symbol table** that maps all symbols (such as variables and labels) to their corresponding physical memory addresses.
   - This mapping ensures that symbols in the assembly code can be correctly replaced with actual memory locations in the machine code.

   > **Symbol Table:** Often implemented as a **hash table** for efficient lookups.

2. **Second Pass:**
   - The assembler replaces all symbols in the assembly code with the memory addresses found in the symbol table.
   - The final output is machine-readable code ready for execution on the hardware.

### **Embedding Assembly in High-Level Code**

Some high-level programming languages, such as **C**, allow programmers to embed assembly code segments directly within their source code. This feature provides:

- **Performance Benefits:**  
  Developers can write highly optimized assembly instructions for critical tasks.
- **Hardware Access:**  
  Embedding assembly enables low-level control over a computer's hardware, which may not be possible using only high-level abstractions.

---

## **Chapters 7 & 8 - Virtual Machine**

High-level programming languages are compiled into an **intermediate language** before being translated into assembly code. This intermediate language is known as **VM language** and runs on a **Virtual Machine (VM)**—a software construct rather than a physical machine.

### **Benefits of the Virtual Machine Paradigm**

1. **Hardware Independence:**  
   High-level languages do not need separate compilation implementations for each hardware platform. Instead, they compile to a common VM language that can run on various devices.

2. **Software Compatibility:**  
   Digital devices only need to support the VM language, enabling them to run a wide range of software without additional effort.

### **Compilation Workflow**

The translation process from high-level code to machine-executable code follows these steps:

1. **High-level programming language** → (Compiler) → **VM Code**
2. **VM Code** → (VM Translator) → **Assembly Code**
3. **Assembly Code** → (Assembler) → **Machine Code**
4. **Machine Code** runs directly on the **hardware (CPU)**.

> **Examples:**
>
> - **Java** uses this model: It compiles into **Bytecode**, which runs on the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
> - **.NET** has a similar implementation.

### **Virtual Machine in Nand2Tetris**

The Nand2Tetris VM is based on a **Stack Architecture (LIFO)** and supports four types of operations:

1. **Arithmetic and Logic Commands:**  
   Pops items off the stack, performs operations, and pushes the result back onto the stack.

2. **Memory Access Commands:**  
   Transfers data between the stack and virtual memory segments.

3. **Program Flow Commands:**  
   Includes **conditional** and **unconditional branching operations**.

   - Conditional jumps evaluate the stack’s topmost element and proceed only if the value is not zero.
   - Used to implement loops, conditional statements, and subroutine calls.

4. **Subroutine Calling:**  
   Manages function calls and returns:
   - Function arguments are pushed onto the stack.
   - The function executes, and the result is placed on top of the stack.

### **VM Commands and Memory Segments**

#### **Arithmetic and Logical Commands**

- `add`, `sub`, `neg`, `eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `and`, `or`, `not`.

#### **Memory Segments**

Each VM function interacts with the following memory segments:

- **argument**, **local**, **static**, **constant**, **this**, **that**, **pointer**, and **temp**.

When a function is called, it gets its own virtual memory segment for:

- **argument**, **local**, **this**, **that**, and **pointer**.

The segments **static**, **temp**, and **constant** are shared by all functions.

### **Stack Frame and Heap**

- **Stack Frame:**

  - Each function call creates a stack frame that contains:
    - Local variables.
    - Arguments.
    - Return address.
    - Pointers (e.g., `this` and `that`).
  - The stack frame isolates the function’s execution context. When the function completes, its stack frame is removed, and the previous context is restored.

- **Heap:**
  - The heap is a memory segment used to store object and array data.
  - The VM manages **two data structures**: the **stack** and the **heap**.

### **Memory Mapping in the VM**

The VM maps memory segments to predefined RAM addresses:

| RAM Address Range | Purpose                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0–15`            | Virtual registers for stack pointer and pointers to local, argument, this, that, and temp segments. |
| `16–255`          | Static variables.                                                                                   |
| `256–2047`        | Stack.                                                                                              |
| `2048–16383`      | Heap.                                                                                               |
| `16384–24575`     | Memory-mapped I/O.                                                                                  |
| `24576–32767`     | Unused memory space.                                                                                |

## **Chapter 9 - High-Level Programming Language**

**Jack** is an **object-oriented programming language** that also supports procedural programming. It serves as a high-level language in the Nand2Tetris project.

### **Features of Jack**

1. **Primitive Data Types:**

   - `int`
   - `char`
   - `boolean`

2. **Object Types:**
   - `String`
   - `Array`
   - User-defined objects (**Classes**).

### **Memory Allocation in Jack**

1. **Primitive Data Types:**

   - Memory is allocated **immediately upon initialization**.

2. **Object Types:**
   - When an object is initialized, only a **pointer** is allocated.
   - Full memory allocation occurs only when the object's **constructor** is called.

### **Jack Standard Library**

The Jack Operating System (OS) provides a standard library that includes additional object types and utility functions. These are covered in detail in **Chapter 12**.

---

### **Chapters 10 & 11 - Compiling High-Level Programming Languages into VM Code**

**Compilation** is the process of transforming source code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Jack) into **VM code**. The virtual machine then executes the compiled VM code, translating it into machine code at runtime.

### **Stages of Compilation**

### **1. Syntax Analysis**

This stage converts raw source code into a structured representation:

- **a) Tokenizing:**  
  Groups input characters into **language atoms** (tokens), such as keywords, identifiers, symbols, etc.

- **b) Parsing:**  
  Arranges the tokens into a hierarchical **XML tree** based on the input language's grammar rules.  
  Example: For an expression like `a + (b * c)`, the tree ensures `b * c` is evaluated before `a + result`.

- **Syntax Errors:**  
  The compiler can detect and report syntax errors during this stage.

### **2. Code Generation**

This stage transforms the parsed XML tree into **VM code**, a simpler, stack-based intermediate language.

- **a) Data Translation**  
  The compiler first creates a **symbol table** to manage variables. The symbol table tracks:
  - **Type**: The data type of the variable (`int`, `boolean`, etc.).
  - **Kind**: The variable's scope and storage (e.g., local, static, argument, or field).
  - **Scope**: Whether the variable is available globally or within a function.
  - **Index**: The order of the variable's declaration.

**Memory Management for Language Constructs at Runtime:**

1. **Primitive Variables (`int`, `boolean`, `char`):**

   - **Local Variables:** Stored in the **local segment** of the VM's memory. Scope is managed using lists of hash tables (which can be implemented as arrays of linked lists).
   - **Static Variables:** Stored in the **static segment**, shared across all instances.
   - **Field Variables:** Stored in the **this segment**. Each object instance has its own copy of these variables.
   - **Argument Variables:** Stored in the **argument segment**. These are placed on the stack as part of a function's stack frame.

2. **Arrays:**

   - The VM allocates memory in the **heap** and returns a pointer to the base address of the memory segment.
   - Example: `arr[3] = 10` translates to `*(base_address + 3) = 10`.

3. **Objects:**
   - Like arrays, object instances are stored in consecutive memory locations.
   - Methods are not duplicated for each object; instead, they are shared, with the **`this` keyword** passed as the first parameter during method calls. This gives the impression that each object encapsulates its own methods.

- **b) Command Translation**
  - **Expressions:** Translated into VM stack operations, such as **push** and **pop**.
  - **Flow Control:** Loops and conditional logic are translated into VM code that evaluates boolean expressions and conditionally jumps to labels.

### **Output of Compilation**

Each Jack file (`xxx.jack`) is compiled into a corresponding VM file (`xxx.vm`).  
OS files written in Jack are also compiled into VM files (`yyy.vm`).

At this stage, all files have unrestricted access to each other. More sophisticated systems implement privilege levels to restrict application access to OS code.

### **Chapter 12 - The Operating System**

The **Jack Operating System (OS)** provides a **standard library** that simplifies interaction between application developers and hardware. This abstraction makes it easier to perform tasks like I/O handling, memory management, and program control.

### **APIs Provided by the Jack OS**

The OS offers APIs for:

- **Interacting with I/O Devices:**  
  Includes devices like the keyboard and screen.

- **Starting/Stopping Programs:**  
  Functions for managing the lifecycle of applications.

- **Memory Management:**  
  Dynamically allocates and deallocates memory for data.

### **Data Types and Functions Implemented by the OS**

The OS includes several built-in data types and utility functions:

1. **String:**

   - Strings are implemented as arrays that map characters to their **ASCII** values, which are stored as binary numbers.

2. **Number Operations:**

   - **Addition/Subtraction:** Handled by the ALU (hardware).
   - **Multiplication/Division:** Implemented at the software level within the OS but can also be hardware-supported.

3. **Array:**

   - Provides tools for creating and manipulating arrays.

### **Interfacing with I/O Devices**

#### **Device Drivers:**

The OS uses **device drivers** to manage communication with hardware. Drivers encapsulate hardware details and provide APIs for developers.

#### **Screen Graphics:**

- The screen uses a **raster/bitmap** system where each pixel is mapped to a specific memory location in RAM.
  - The top-left pixel corresponds to `(0,0)`.
  - Diagonal lines appear jagged due to the pixel grid, but this effect is imperceptible to the human eye because of the retina's resolution limitations.

#### **Keyboard Input:**

- Characters typed on the keyboard are mapped to specific memory locations in RAM, enabling direct processing by the OS.

### **Dynamic Memory Management**

The OS handles **dynamic memory allocation** and **garbage collection** for runtime variables and data. This is achieved through collaboration between the **OS**, **compiler**, and **VM**.

- **alloc() and dealloc():**  
  Implemented using a linked list algorithm called **freeList**.

- **Heap:**

  - A segment of RAM used for tracking dynamically allocated memory (persistent data beyond a single function execution).

- **Stack:**
  - A **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** structure used to track running function calls, local variables, and arguments.

### **Limitations of the Jack OS**

The Jack OS is a simplified system and lacks many features commonly found in full-fledged operating systems:

1. **Process Handling:**

   - No support for multi-threading or multi-processing, typically handled by OS kernels.

2. **Disk Management:**

   - No file system or persistent storage capabilities.

3. **User Interfaces:**

   - Lacks command-line or graphical user interfaces.

4. **Privilege Separation:**

   - No distinction between OS-level and application-level access privileges.

5. **Security and Communication:**

   - No built-in security protocols or communication mechanisms.
