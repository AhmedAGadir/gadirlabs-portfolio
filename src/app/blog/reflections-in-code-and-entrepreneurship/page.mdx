# Brain Dump: Code, Entrepreneurship and More

Here are some end-of-year ramblings about what I&apos;ve learned over the past two years starting a few failed businesses as a Software Developer. I&apos;ve also included a list of recommended resources.

## Lessons from Starting a Clothing Brand

In 2022, while becoming complacent in my career, I was inundated with get-rich-quick schemes on social media. Seeking an easier way to make more money, I decided to start a business. The first project I deeply invested in was an Arabic-themed sportswear brand. Looking back, it was a terrible idea, but it taught me valuable lessons:

1. If it&apos;s hard work to explain your product&apos;s value, it&apos;s probably not a good product.
2. If you can&apos;t build the key aspects of your product yourself, you&apos;re at the mercy of others (even if you&apos;re paying them).
3. Sticky products (those with repeat customers) are better than one-time purchases.
4. Any idea can work given enough time and effort, but some simply aren&apos;t worth pursuing.

I&apos;ve since circled back to writing software and decided to ignore all the noise online. Anything worth doing is hard work, and setting that expectation that whatever you&apos;re pursuing is going to be difficult anchors you down and prevents fleeting fads from pulling you off course.

## Not Knowing Something Should Never Be a Barrier

While building my current project, [ArabyBuddy](https://arabybuddy.com), I&apos;ve faced choices between launching quickly with familiar tools or taking detours to learn the right tools for the job. Contrary to common advice, I&apos;ve found immense value in the latter approach. Taking the time to learn and use the best tools has allowed me to build a better product. Here are some examples:

- **Learning Figma**  
  A weekend spent learning Figma has allowed me to conceptualize designs 5â€“10x faster. The key takeaway: If you don&apos;t need to write code to test your ideas, you&apos;ll be less precious about discarding bad ones.

- **Learning Relational Databases**
  Learning to organize and work with large amounts of data makes you smarter. Front-loading the effort and designing an application&apos;s database before writing any code means having better data integrity and consistency in your DB, as well as clearer application requirements.

- **Mobile Development**
  ArabyBuddy was originally going to be a web app. Technologies like Nextjs and Vercel allow for rapid prototyping and quickly testing a product. However the nature of the product, a language learning app, meant that a mobile app was a better fit. It means more learning and a longer time to launch, but it&apos;s the right choice for the product.

In all of these cases, taking what looked like the long way has resulted in a better product and time saved down the line.

My opinion is that, unless you are a seasoned vet, don&apos;t let speed be the deciding factor on your tech stack. Choose the right tools for the job, even if it means learning something new.

## All You Had to Do Was Ask

Not to sound mystical, but setting a clear goal aligns the world around you to make it happen. Since committing to building software products, I&apos;ve received incredible support:

- A senior architect at my current job now mentors me, providing invaluable guidance after I requested just 15 minutes of his time.
- Subject-matter experts collaborate with me on my current project, generously sharing their expertise.
- Talented colleagues recommend essential resources, helping me grow professionally.

These experiences reinforce a simple truth: people are willing to help if you simply ask.
