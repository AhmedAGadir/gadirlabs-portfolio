# Brain Dump: Code, Entrepreneurship and more

Here are some ramblings I've gathered in the past 2 years working as a Software Developer and starting a few failed businesses. I've also included a list of recommended resources.

## Lessons from Starting a Clothing Brand

In 2022, while feeling complacent in my career, I was inundated with get-rich-quick schemes on social media. Seeking an easier way to make more money, I decided to start a business. The first project I deeply invested in was an Arabic-themed sportswear brand. Looking back, it was a terrible idea, but it taught me valuable lessons:

1. If it's hard work to explain your product's value, it's probably not a good product.
2. If you cant' build the product yourself, you'll have to pay someone else to do it.
3. Sticky products (those with repeat customers) are better than one-time purchases.
4. Any idea can work given enough time and effort, but some simply aren't worth pursuing.

I've since circled back to writing software and decided to ignore all the noise online. Anything worth doing is hard work.

## Not Knowing Something Should Never Be a Barrier

While building my current project, [ArabyBuddy](https://arabybuddy.com), I’ve faced choices between launching quickly with familiar tools or taking detours to learn the right tools for the job. Contrary to common advice, I’ve found immense value in the latter approach. Taking the time to learn and use the best tools has allowed me to build a better product. Here are some examples:

- **Learning Figma**  
  A weekend spent learning Figma has allowed me to conceptualize designs 5–10x faster. The key takeaway: If you don’t need to write code to test your ideas, you’ll be less precious about discard bad ones.

- **Learning Relational Databases**
  Learning to organize and work with large amounts of data makes you smarter. Front-loading the effort and design an application's database before writing any code means having better data integrity and consistency in your DB, as well as clearer application requirements.

Over the past two years, I’ve improved in **UX Design**, **Backend Development**, **Relational Databases**, **System Design**, and **Computer Architecture**. Each skill has contributed to my overarching goal: building great products.

### Immediate Next Steps

My next areas of focus are:

- Mobile Development
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Monitoring
- Distributed Systems
- 3D Modeling
- Game Theory

Long-term, I aim to understand the entire product development lifecycle. Looking back, those uncles and aunties who chewed my ear off about the ‘value of education’ were right. Even now, at 30 years old, I can see that the best ROIs I’ve received came from investing in my own knowledge, not crypto or stocks.

## The World Belongs to Those Who Ask for It

Not to sound mystical, but setting a clear goal often aligns the world around you to make it happen. Since committing to building software products, I’ve received incredible support:

- A senior architect at my current job now mentors me after I asked for just 15 minutes of his time to discuss what I should learn next.
- Two PhDs in linguistics and a skilled animator are collaborating with me on my current project.
- Experienced and talented developers I work with frequently recommend the exact resources I need to level up.

I also count the authors of my favourite books and online content as mentors. It's hard to overstate the value of years of experience and wisdom distilled into a few hundred pages. Brings about a lot of gratitude.

{/\* Your blog doesn’t come across as overtly narcissistic or self-centered, but there are subtle aspects that could unintentionally feel that way, depending on your audience. It largely depends on the tone and framing of your reflections. Here’s a breakdown:

Why It Doesn’t Read as Narcissistic:

    1.	Candidness About Failures:
    •	You openly discuss your mistakes (e.g., the failed clothing brand) and frame them as learning experiences. This shows humility and self-awareness, not arrogance.
    2.	Focus on Lessons Learned:
    •	Much of the blog revolves around actionable takeaways, which shifts the focus from you to the reader. You’re sharing knowledge, not just talking about yourself for the sake of it.
    3.	Gratitude and Collaboration:
    •	You emphasize the importance of mentorship, collaboration, and learning from others. These elements balance the narrative and showcase a willingness to listen and grow.

Where It Could Seem Self-Centered:

    1.	Frequent Use of “I”:
    •	While it’s natural for a personal blog, the heavy focus on your journey, skills, and achievements might alienate some readers. Framing your experiences in a way that explicitly invites readers to relate to or learn from them could mitigate this.
    2.	List of Skills and Goals:
    •	Listing the areas where you’ve improved or your future plans (e.g., mobile development, game theory) might come off as a bit boastful if not contextualized. Instead of simply stating these, you could tie them back to how readers might benefit from similar growth or why these skills matter in a larger context.
    3.	“The World Belongs to Those Who Ask for It” Section:
    •	While inspiring, this section might sound like you’re attributing your success to a unique trait or mindset that others might not possess. Balancing this with acknowledgment of luck, privilege, or the contributions of others can soften the impression.

How to Ensure It Doesn’t Feel Narcissistic:

    1.	Empathize with the Reader:
    •	Use phrases like “What I’ve learned might help you if…” or “You might relate to this if…” to explicitly frame your experiences as advice or shared insights.
    2.	Highlight the Broader Context:
    •	When discussing your skills or goals, explain how they align with trends or challenges others might face, making the post less about you and more about universal themes.
    3.	Tone Down the Accomplishment-Driven Focus:
    •	Instead of focusing on what you’ve achieved, focus on the struggles and lessons along the way. Readers often resonate more with challenges than with success.
    4.	Acknowledge External Factors:
    •	Adding a line or two about how others, luck, or circumstances have helped you along the way adds humility and nuance.

Final Thought:

The blog isn’t inherently narcissistic, but without careful framing, it could come across as overly self-focused to certain readers. By shifting the emphasis slightly—making your personal story a lens for broader insights—you can avoid that impression entirely while still showcasing your journey. \*/}
