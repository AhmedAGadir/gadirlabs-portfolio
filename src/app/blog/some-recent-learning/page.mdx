# Brain Dump: Code, Entrepreneurship and more

Here are some ramblings I've gathered in the past 2 years working as a Software Developer. I've also included a list of recommended resources.

## Lessons from Starting a Clothing Brand

In 2022, while feeling complacent in my career, I was inundated with get-rich-quick schemes on social media. Seeking an easier way to make more money, I decided to start a business. The first project I deeply invested in was an Arabic-themed sportswear brand. Looking back, it was a terrible idea, but it taught me valuable lessons:

1. If it's hard work to explain your product's value, it's probably not a good product.
2. If you cant' build the product yourself, you'll have to pay someone else to do it.
3. Sticky products (those with repeat customers) are better than one-time purchases.
4. Any idea can work given enough time and effort, but some simply aren't worth pursuing.

I've since circled back to writing software and decided to ignore all the noise online. Anything good is hard work, and I'm willing to put in the effort to build something great.

## Not Knowing Something Should Never Be a Barrier

While building my current project, **ArabyBuddy**, I’ve faced choices between launching quickly with familiar tools or taking detours to learn the right tools for the job. Contrary to common advice, I’ve found immense value in the latter approach. Taking the time to learn and use the best tools has allowed me to build a better product. Here are some examples:

- **Learning Figma**  
  A weekend spent learning Figma has allowed me to conceptualize designs 5–10x faster. The key takeaway: If you don’t need to write code to test your ideas, you’ll be less hesitant to discard bad ones.

- **Learning Relational Databases**
  Learning to organize and work with large amounts of data makes you smarter. Front-loading the effort and design an application's database before writing any code means having better data integrity and consistency in your DB, as well as clearer application requirements.

Over the past two years, I’ve improved in **UX Design**, **Backend Development**, **Relational Databases**, **System Design**, and **Computer Architecture**. Each skill has contributed to my overarching goal: building great products.

### Immediate Next Steps

My next areas of focus are:

- Mobile Development
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Monitoring
- Distributed Systems
- 3D Modeling
- Game Theory

Long-term, I aim to understand the entire product development lifecycle. Looking back, those uncles and aunties who chewed my ear off about the 'value of education' were right. Even now at 30 years old, I can see that the best ROIs I've received came from investing in my own knowledge, not crypto or stocks.

## The World Belongs to Those Who Ask for It

Not to sound mystical, but setting a clear goal often aligns the world around you to make it happen. Since committing to building software products, I’ve received incredible support:

- A senior architect at my current job offered to mentor me after I asked for just 15 minutes of his time to discuss what I should learn next.
- Two PhDs in linguistics are collaborating with me on my current project.
- Experienced developers have recommended the exact resources I needed, just when I needed them.

I also count the authors of great books and online content as mentors. It’s awe-inspiring to distill years of experience and wisdom into a few hundred pages. For all of this, I am profoundly grateful.
