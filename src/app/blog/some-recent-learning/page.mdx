# Brain Dump: Code, Entrepreneurship and more

In the spirit of good being better than perfect, I'm going to share some messy thoughts and ramble over what I've learned in the last 2 years.
Knowledge shared is knowledge doubled, so no need to keep any of these lessons to myself.

## Lessons from starting a Clothing Brand

The first project I got really invested into was an arabic-themed sportswear brand. Looking back, I can see it was a terrible idea but I did learn many valuable lessons:

1. If it's hard work explaining your product's value, it's probably not a good product
2. If you cant build the product yourself, you'll have to pay someone else to do it
3. If your product doesn't solve a problem (like luxury items), its value is entirely dependant the brand it carries, which can take years to build.
4. Sticky products - i.e. those with repeat customers, are better than one-time purchases
5. Any idea can work given enough time and effort, but some are just not worth it

I've since pivoted into making software, which is more in line with my skills and interests. More importantly money and sunken costs are no longer the bottleneck, so I can move about more freely until I hit something that really delivers value.

## Not knowing something should never be a barrier

In building my current project, ArabyBuddy, I've had to decide a number of times between launching quickly using the tools I know, or taking a detour to learn the right tools for the project.
Contrary to what's commonly preached, I'm finding a lot of value in taking my time to create a great product. Some of the ways this has manifested:

1. Learning Figma:
   A weekend spent learning figma gave me the tools to conceptualise designs about 5-10x faster. The benefits are numerous but to put it succinctly: if you dont need to code to put out your ideas - you will be much less precious about discarding bad ones, and you can focus solely on creating the best product.
2. Relational Databases
   Most frontend developers learn to work with NOSQL databases for when they need to prototype ideas. For my current project I decided using a relational database was a better fit. I was initially resistant to the idea, but to my surprise, learning how to handle and organize large amounts of data is really enjoyable and makes you smarter in a way I'm struggling to word.

From a coding perspective I've learned more in UX Design, Backend Development, System Design and Computer Architecture.

Some future areas of study and interest are: Mobile Development, Cloud Infrastructure, Monitoring, Distributed Systems, 3D Modelling and Game Theory.

Even if spending all this time learning technology delays launching my app, It's definitely not a loss. I've seen in my own life the best ROIs I've ever got came from knowledge - not Crypto or Stock Markets or anything else.

I've also recently been listening to a lot of Steve Jobs' old interviews - the obsession he had with building the best possible products inspires me to grind it out and be better.

## To build great products - you've gotta be full stack

## The world belongs to those who ask for it

Not to sound mystical, but setting a goal has a way of making the universe conspire to make it happen.

Ever since I decided to dedicate myself to being a founder, I've had so much help come my way:

- 2 pHDs in linguistics building my current project with me
- Mentoring from a Senior Architect at work - He offered to do this after I asked him if I could just have 15 minutes of his time to guide me on becoming full stack
- Senior and talent developers recommend me just the right resources I need at the right time.
- Mentors - via authors in the form of great books and online content - Experts in product development, business, and coding. A great book is like no other in my opinion - You can feel when hundreds of hours covering years of experience and wisdom are distilled into a few hundred pages. Very grateful for it all.
